        <p class="card-text" style="color: white;">One Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda since 1997 and
          is still ongoing.<br>

          The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a young man whose body gains the properties of rubber
          after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit, and his diverse crew of pirates, named the Straw Hat Pirates.
          Luffy explores the ocean in search of the world's ultimate treasure known as "One Piece" in order to become the next Pirate King.<br>

          One Piece has a huge Fandom that can be seen in websites with all the fanfiction and fan-arts, from all the OC (original characters) out there and the forums dedicated to One Piece as well as One Piece cosplay in the
          Anime Cons.<br>

          The One Piece fans have no special name that they are going for, although there have been debut about calling themselves kaizoku, nakama or even newkama, however none of them are really used so One Piece fans are recognised as just One Piece fans or shorter OP fans.<br>
          The OP fans can be recognised by closing, tattoos, and talking style. The fans also have started to use some
          of the worlds that are used in original One Piece anime and movies because of the awkward translation and just
          because it sounds cooler in Japanese. For example instead of friend, crewmate, teammate, fans are saying
          Japanese version – nakama. Also instead of pirate – kaizoku; strawhat – mugiwara; seven warlords of the sea –
          shicibukai. Also some of the OP fans are using One Piece laughter styles, such as shahahaha (Arlong`s
          laughter), Yohohohoho (Brook`s laughter), fuffuffuffuffu (Doflamingo`s laughter) or just self-created one. And
          it is so hilarious to hear how someone is trying to laugh. Often there is seen that OP fans acts and uses
          phrases of one of the One Piece characters. For example fan that acts like a Brook will often laugh with this
          characters laughter yohohohoho and use a lot of skull jokes such as: “I could play a flute instead of violin,
          if I would have lungs!
