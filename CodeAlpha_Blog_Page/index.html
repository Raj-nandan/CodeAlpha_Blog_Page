      <a href="#" class="post-content">The film follows a Japanese high school student named Shoya. We learn that when
        he was in sixth grade, he bullied a deaf girl named Shoko that was in his class. Eventually the bullying got so
        bad that Shoko was moved to a different school, and Shoya was outcasted from the other students, even though
        they also contributed to the bullying. Now entering high school, Shoya is depressed and struggles to connect
        with other people. Shoya discovers that Shoko is attending the same high school as him, and he vows to redeem
        himself by becoming friends with her. The film follows the two as they try to rebuild their relationship while
        struggling with their own personal problems and with growing up.</a>

      <a href="#" class="post-content">We all know AI is the future. ChatGPT is a trending topic everywhere in the world
        right now, ChatGPT is a chatbot/trained-model designed by OpenAI, still being developed and trained by their
        engineers.

        This is the technical description provided by the chatbot itself – ChatGPT is a large language model trained by
        OpenAI. It is capable of generating human-like text in a variety of styles and formats, such as answering
        questions, composing stories, and even coding. It uses a deep learning technique called transformer architecture
        and has been trained on a massive dataset of text from the internet. It can be used for a variety of natural
        language processing tasks such as text generation, conversation simulation and more.

      <a href="#" class="post-content">“It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and
        underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis,” writes James Clear in Atomic Habits.
        Why?
        Well, because of Hollywood and media and everything that’s so frighteningly bad with this world.
        When you see a movie about an artist, you don’t really see him tirelessly working on his painting or poem for
        months and months, making small improvements to it day in day out.
        Oh no!</a>

        5 Point Someone</a>

      <a href="#" class="post-content">
        This is the story of three friends who are pursuing engineering at one of India's most prestigious institutions,
        IIT. It is important to note that it is a common deception among Indian novelists who want to discover, in their
        plans, the similarities in their upbringing, education, or emotional anxiety. Chetan could not think of anything
        else but to risk his experience by continuing his writing of Indian fiction.
        This is good in another way and in another context, it reduces his thinking because he can only write down what
        he has experienced - so strengths and weaknesses go hand in hand. He also introduced the novel's strategy in his
        later days by resolving the issue of IIT Delhi college, his alma mater.</a>

        Naruto Shippuden

      </a>

      <a href="#" class="post-content">Naruto is one of the most popular Japanese manga series, one that was written and
        illustrated by the legendary Masashi Kishimoto. It was published by Shueisha and it ran from 2000 to 2015, with
        Naruto Part I containing 27 volumes and with Naruto Part II containing 45 volumes. All 72 volumes have been
        released in English as well, which helps explain why Naruto is the best anime in terms of its reach and
        popularity.

        As for what type of anime is Naruto, it was officially described as an adventure fantasy comedy focused on
        martial arts.

        There was also a Naruto anime TV series, with the one titled Naruto airing from 2002 to 2007 and the one titled
        Naruto: Shippuden running from 2007 to 2017. The latter, the Naruto: Shippuden series, was especially popular
        and there are still many fans of it, even though the last episode aired over five years ago. </a>

              Silent Voice. It was an ideal film for uniting two sets of viewers; those who’d become aware of Naoko
